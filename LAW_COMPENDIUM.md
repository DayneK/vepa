## 1. Reading This Compendium

### 1.1 Evidence and status notation

- **Implemented:** the solver or a law-group module contains a runtime dispatch path for the law.
- **Gated:** execution is conditional on the corresponding law-state bit, and may additionally be subject to a hard dependency.
- **Proxy:** the implementation intentionally approximates a named phenomenon using bounded forces, state changes, or signal operations; it is not a claim of physical completeness.
- **Parameter links:** names in parentheses identify the live storage namespace: `DNA`, `Stride`, or `World`.
- **Source annotations:** the registry and metadata originate in `src/constants.js`; category-specific behavior is organized in `src/physics/lawgroups/*.js`; the orchestration loop is `src/physics/solver.js`; state representation is in `src/state/lawState.js`.

### 1.2 Runtime execution model

1. The UI selects law bits and serializes them into the law state.
2. The solver builds an active-law view and iterates particles and neighbor pairs.
3. Pairwise laws read positions, velocities, mass, radius, energy, DNA cache, bonds, signal, and other stride fields.
4. Per-particle laws modify accumulated acceleration or particle state.
5. Integration applies bounded acceleration, drag, velocity limits, toroidal/world constraints, and finite-value guards.
6. Biology, chemistry, thermal, information, and quantum passes update state fields and lifecycle outcomes.
7. The HUD reports particle count and tick telemetry; the law info module resolves four-tier help metadata.

### 2.3 State and storage layout

The first seven stride values are position and velocity (`POS_X/Y/Z`, `VEL_X/Y/Z`), followed by `MASS` and `SPECIES_ID`. DNA cache values occupy stride 8–49 and correspond to the first 42 DNA parameters. Core dynamic fields include `ENERGY` 50, `AGE` 51, `DEAD` 52, color 53–55, `RADIUS` 56, `SIGNAL` 57, bond count 58, bond partners 59–60 and 81–84, `MEMORY` 61, `HUNGER` 62, `ARMOR` 63, temperature 66, charge 67, quantum phase/state 68–76, energy reservoirs 77–78, radiation exposure 80, deterministic chaos state 85–87, symbol/superposition state 88–95, and group fields 96–97.

### 2.4 Dependency model

Hard dependencies currently include: `SENESCENCE → LIFE`, `TELEPORT → ENTANGLEMENT`, `ENCRYPTION → COMMS`, `FEEDBACK → MEMORY`, `OBSERVER → MEMORY`, `NAVIGATION → MEMORY`, and `ISOMERIZATION → (BOND or POLYMER)`. Soft dependencies document synergies without disabling the dependent law: LANGUAGE and SIGNAL_BOOST use signal sources; ANTENNA and POLARIZATION use signal channels; MIND uses COMMS or TELEPATHY; WAVE_PARTICLE uses OBSERVER for measurement semantics.

## 3. Category Reports

### 3.1 Physics

**Role:** foundational attraction, damping, contact, gravity-adjacent, and field primitives. Physics contains the oldest core laws plus later environmental and singularity additions. Its pairwise forces are generally bounded and use mass/radius-aware falloffs. `FIELD` is a central-gradient primitive; `ELECTRIC_FIELD` belongs to Electromagnetism.

**Members:** GRAV, DRAG, ENTR, BUOYANCY, COLL, ACCR, PLANETARY, VOID, BOND, SINGULARITY, FRICTION, TIDE, HORIZON, RADIATION_PRESSURE, MASS_INERTIA, FIELD.

**Interactions:** GRAV/PLANETARY/ACCR shape aggregation; COLL/BOND/FIELD constrain local structure; HORIZON/SINGULARITY provide extreme-mass behavior; TIDE and RADIATION_PRESSURE introduce gradients and outward energy transfer. Physics is the main substrate for all other categories.

### 3.2 Mechanics

**Role:** the slate structural and motion layer introduced at indexes 128–135. Mechanics is deliberately separate from legacy names `TURBULENCE`, `CENTRIPETAL`, `ROTATION`, and `ELASTICITY` as law indexes; elasticity remains a DNA material parameter used by collision response. The active set is CONTACT, MOMENTUM, INERTIA, TORQUE, CONSTRAINT, FRAGMENTATION, TOPOLOGY, and ADHESION.

**Members:** CONTACT, MOMENTUM, INERTIA, TORQUE, CONSTRAINT, FRAGMENTATION, TOPOLOGY, ADHESION.

**Interactions:** CONTACT and CONSTRAINT manage geometry; MOMENTUM and INERTIA govern response; TORQUE supplies tangential rotation; FRAGMENTATION opposes over-fast structural impacts; TOPOLOGY reads bond connectivity; ADHESION attracts without mass merging. Mechanics is displayed first in the UI with a small divider and has dedicated help records.

### 3.3 Biology

**Role:** energy-driven lifecycle, ecological interaction, signaling, genetics, and survival. Biology changes particle state and can create, merge, modify, or remove entities, so it is more lifecycle-sensitive than force-only categories.

**Members:** LIFE, GLOW, AFFINITY, REPRO, TRACK, SENESCENCE, ENERGY, RADIATION, GENOTYPE, PHENOTYPE, PREDATION, COMMS, SYMBIOSIS, PARASITE, HIBERNATION, IMMUNITY.

**Interactions:** LIFE/ENERGY maintain metabolism; REPRO/SENESCENCE govern population turnover; AFFINITY/PREDATION/SYMBIOSIS/PARASITE create ecological pressure; GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE/RADIATION alter inheritance and expression; GLOW/COMMS/TRACK expose signal pathways.

### 3.4 Chemistry

**Role:** local reaction, medium, redox, molecular structure, and material transformation. Chemistry predominantly reads reaction thresholds, conductivity, polarity, temperature, bonds, and energy reservoirs.

**Members:** CATALYSIS_LAW, SOLVATION, ACIDITY, OXIDATION, POLYMER, ISOMERIZATION, CHIRALITY, CRYSTALLIZATION, REDUCTION, ALLOY, ELECTROLYSIS, PHOTOLYSIS, PRECIPITATION, NEUTRALIZATION, STOICHIOMETRY, AUTOCATALYSIS.

### 3.5 Thermodynamics

**Role:** temperature, heat transfer, phase change, pressure, and thermal feedback. Thermal laws operate on `TEMPERATURE`, `ENERGY`, `STORED_ENERGY`, heat capacity, phase thresholds, and neighborhood gradients.

**Members:** HEAT, COLD, CONVECTION, PHASE_RADIATION, SUBLIMATION, MELT, BOIL, CONDENSE, DEPOSIT, EXOTHERMIC, ADIABATIC, COMPRESSION, EXPANSION, EQUILIBRIUM, LATENT_HEAT, RUNAWAY.

**Interactions:** HEAT/COLD/EQUILIBRIUM/CONVECTION move thermal energy; phase laws use critical thresholds and latent buffers; ADIABATIC/COMPRESSION/EXPANSION model density-pressure response; RUNAWAY and EXOTHERMIC add positive feedback, subject to bounds.

### 3.6 Metaphysics

**Role:** time/space abstractions, agency, mind, soul, psychic channels, and synchrony. These are simulation constructs implemented through phase, memory, signal, position, and velocity rather than claims about literal metaphysics.

**Members:** TIME_DILATION, DIMENSIONALITY, CHAOS, ORDER, FATE, WILL, SOUL_LAW, MIND, TELEPATHY, CLAIRVOYANCE, PRECOGNITION, ASTRAL, ENTANGLEMENT, CONSCIOUSNESS, PERCEPTION, SYNCHRONICITY.

**Interactions:** CHAOS/ORDER shape organization; TIME_DILATION/PRECOGNITION affect temporal proxies; MIND/TELEPATHY/CLAIRVOYANCE/PERCEPTION use signal and neighborhood state; SOUL/ASTRAL/SYNCHRONICITY use persistent identity and phase; ENTANGLEMENT is a correlation substrate used by QUANTUM teleportation.

### 3.7 Electromagnetism

**Role:** charge, fields, conduction, magnetic coupling, radiation, ionization, and signal polarization. This category uses `CHARGE`, `ELECTRIC_ENERGY`, `STORED_ENERGY`, `POLARITY`, conductivity, and magnetic moment.

**Members:** CHARGE_LAW, ELECTRIC_FIELD, CURRENT, RESISTANCE, CAPACITANCE, INDUCTANCE, MAGNETISM, RESONANCE, FLUX, IONIZATION, DISCHARGE, PLASMA, SUPERCONDUCTIVITY, ANTENNA, SHIELDING, POLARIZATION.

**Interactions:** CHARGE_LAW/ELECTRIC_FIELD/FLUX provide forces; CURRENT/RESISTANCE/CAPACITANCE/INDUCTANCE transport or store energy; MAGNETISM/RESONANCE/ANTENNA organize fields and signals; IONIZATION/DISCHARGE/PLASMA bridge impacts, temperature, and charge; SHIELDING/POLARIZATION filter effects.

### 3.8 Information

**Role:** memory, learning, signaling, symbols, prediction, code, protocol, language, culture, history, and navigation. Information laws commonly alter `MEMORY`, `SIGNAL`, trail fields, phase, or DNA rather than applying direct mechanical force.

**Members:** MEMORY, PATTERN, STIGMERGY, SIGNAL_BOOST, LEARN, SYMBOL, METRIC, PREDICT, CODE, PROTOCOL, FEEDBACK, LANGUAGE, CULTURE, HISTORY, NAVIGATION, ENCRYPTION.

**Interactions:** MEMORY/HISTORY provide persistence; PATTERN/STIGMERGY/NAVIGATION turn traces into gradients; LEARN/FEEDBACK alter motion and retention; SIGNAL_BOOST/PROTOCOL/LANGUAGE/ENCRYPTION regulate communication; SYMBOL/CODE/CULTURE transmit identity and traits.

### 3.9 Quantum

## 5. Related Data

### 5.1 Parameter namespaces

**DNA parameters** are species/genome values, with 64 indexes covering force, viscosity, torque, jitter, polarity, alpha, symmetry, hidden mass, stiffness, fusion, lifecycle rates, signal controls, neighborhood radius, tuning channels, inertia, friction, velocity limits, radius, elasticity, bond angle, conductivity, magnetic moment, energy efficiency, reproductive/ecological traits, reaction/thermal traits, memory, affinity, dominance, crossover, epigenetic and regulatory expansion.

**Stride parameters** are per-particle runtime fields. They hold physical state, lifecycle state, bonds, memory, signal, energy reservoirs, thermal/electromagnetic state, quantum state, trails, and group membership.

**World parameters** are global controls. Names referenced by the law map include GLOBAL_G, DAMPING, FRICTION_COEFF, ENTROPY, HEAT_CAPACITY, LIGHT_LEVEL, DECAY_RATE, reaction/phase thresholds, signal ranges, magnetic/quantum scales, and law-specific gain/limit factors. The authoritative list and defaults are in `src/state/worldParams.js`.

### 5.2 Important stride fields

| Range | Fields | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 0–7 | position, velocity, mass, species | geometry and identity |
| 8–49 | DNA cache | fast per-particle trait reads |
| 50–67 | energy, lifecycle, visual, bonds, memory, armor, temperature, charge | core dynamics |
| 68–76 | phases, soul, trails, entanglement | quantum/metaphysical/information state |
| 77–84 | energy reservoirs, reproductive/radiation state, extra bonds | EM, lifecycle, polymer support |
| 85–95 | chaos, symbol, superposition, measurement, self-model | expanded law state |
| 96–97 | group ID/role | civilization/group registry state |

### 5.3 Law state and bitmasks

`LAW_COUNT` is 136, so the state representation must cover indexes beyond the original 128-bit documentation. The UI and solver use the same index registry; inactive bits prevent dispatch. Multi-state UI controls are separate from the ordinary on/off law bit and cycle their configured state values.

### 5.4 Runtime safeguards

The solver uses finite-value guards, bounded force/acceleration clamps, nonzero-distance checks, mass/radius floors, temperature/energy limits, and velocity caps. These safeguards are part of the implementation contract: they keep proxy laws composable and prevent a single extreme interaction from producing NaN/Infinity propagation.

## 6. Verification and Known Boundaries

- Registry invariant: indexes are contiguous 0–135 and `LAW_COUNT` is 136.
- Category invariant: the nine category arrays cover the registry exactly once.
- Help coverage: the canonical help table provides `hint`, `explanation`, and `system` records for the full registry; 62 laws currently also provide the optional `advanced` fourth tier. The eight Mechanics laws and four later Physics/EM additions are included in the canonical merge.
- Current unit verification recorded during extraction: **88 test files, 870 tests, all passing**.
- Syntax verification recorded during extraction: all JavaScript files under `src` and `tests` passed `node --check`.
- The compendium describes source behavior, not an independent scientific validation. Several names are metaphorical or toy-model proxies; their implementation notes intentionally state the actual state transitions rather than implying real-world equivalence.
- Legacy names `TURBULENCE`, `CENTRIPETAL`, and `ROTATION` remain in some explanatory/parameter/icon compatibility text but are not current `LAW_INDEXES` entries. `ELASTICITY` remains a DNA material parameter and is used by collision logic.
