# VEPA4 Lawgroup Implementation Contract

> **Status:** canonical implementation contract
> **Authority:** runtime source and executable tests outrank this document
> **Scope:** `src/physics/lawgroups/*.js`

## 1. Purpose

Lawgroup modules contain category-owned, stateless simulation primitives. They describe bounded in-engine behavior; names such as gravity, quantum, consciousness, or relativity do not imply physical completeness.

## 2. Required implementation rules

1. Export named functions with stable, descriptive names.
2. Do not keep mutable simulation state at module scope.
3. Receive all runtime state through function arguments: particle views, bases, DNA/world parameters, time step, and deterministic PRNG where needed.
4. Use `STRIDE_INDEXES`, `DNA_INDEXES`, and `LAW_INDEXES` rather than magic offsets or hardcoded law numbers.
5. Return finite bounded values or explicit `null`/`false` when an effect does not apply.
6. Do not mutate the particle buffer from diagnostic or inspection helpers.
7. Keep CONTACT geometric separation distinct from COLL impact impulse.
8. Document hard dependencies, input fields, output fields, and proxy/model limitations in the corresponding generated law record or source comment.

## 3. Solver integration contract

The solver owns law gating, ordering, accumulation, integration, clamping, lifecycle transitions, and buffer mutation. A lawgroup function must not silently bypass the active law mask or mutate unrelated subsystem state.

Pairwise functions should use the shared minimum-image geometry contract. Hot-loop callers may use scalar calculations equivalent to `src/physics/pairGeometry.js` when allocation avoidance is demonstrated and covered by parity tests.

## 4. Evidence levels

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Registry | Law exists in the canonical index/category map. |
| Dispatch | Solver has an active-law gate and call path. |
| Behavior | Focused executable test observes the intended bounded effect. |
| Invariant | Tests establish a stated symmetry, conservation, or non-mutation property for a defined fixture. |
| Fidelity | Numerical or scientific equivalence has been demonstrated against a named reference and tolerance. |

Registry, dispatch, and behavior evidence must not be reported as fidelity evidence.

## 5. Review checklist

- [ ] Named constants used for stride/DNA/law access.
- [ ] Finite-value and clamp behavior defined.
- [ ] Dependencies and overlap with neighboring laws recorded.
- [ ] Focused behavior tests added.
- [ ] Invariant tests added where the model claims one.
- [ ] Browser/device tests added for browser-only execution paths.
- [ ] Generated specification regenerated and checked.
