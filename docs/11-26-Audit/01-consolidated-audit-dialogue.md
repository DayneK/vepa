# VEPA4 Audit Conversation — Consolidated Record

**Collection:** 11-26 Audit
**Prepared:** 2026-09-16
**Project state referenced:** VEPA4 9.1.4
**Record type:** source-aligned reconstruction and consolidation

> This document consolidates the audit questions, the conclusions represented by the checked-in audit artifacts, and the unresolved questions carried into the remediation request. The original chat transcript is not stored in the repository; therefore, statements attributed to prior responses are reconstructed from the live source tree and the existing reports, not presented as verbatim transcript.

## 1. Scope and evidence boundary

The consolidated record covers the discussion beginning with the deep repository/program/documentation audit and ending with the batch 3+4 architectural conclusions. The relevant repository evidence is:

- `docs/FEATURE_STATUS_MATRIX.md` — feature status and implementation boundaries.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_RESOLUTION_MATRIX.md` — the eight unresolved architectural conclusions.
- `docs/AUDIT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` — prioritized actions and acceptance criteria.
- `docs/DEEP_AUDIT_CLARIFICATIONS.md` — stride, law-count, audit ownership, and WebGPU clarification.
- `docs/AUDIT_CORPUS_OWNERSHIP.md` — `docs/audit/laws/a3/` inventory and authority policy.
- `docs/EXPORT_SNAPSHOT_POLICY.md` — export ownership and retention policy.
- `docs/LEGACY_TOOLING_INVENTORY.md` — historical tooling classification.
- `docs/spec/` — generated source-derived specifications and manifests.
- `src/`, `tests/`, `bench/` — runtime and executable evidence.

## 2. Conversation arc

### 2.1 Initial deep audit

**Question:** Understand the project deeply, clean up the root directory, review file structure, assess functionality, identify claims that are complete but only partially implemented, and produce a comprehensive feature/implementation matrix.

**Consolidated answer:** The application is a browser-based ESM simulation with a flat particle buffer, law registry, worker/CPU execution model, renderer, UI, intelligence engines, benchmark tooling, generated specifications, and historical audit/export material. The correct status vocabulary is not simply complete/incomplete. Each feature must be classified as operational, exact-reference, approximate, bounded proxy, opt-in, partial, metadata-only, experimental, or historical. Source and executable tests are behavioral authority; prose and generated reports are evidence and navigation.

The resulting audit direction was to preserve source/runtime modularity, avoid deleting evidence before provenance is known, and make feature claims agree with the live implementation. In particular, FMM, WebGPU, law ontology depth, mechanics geometry consolidation, export ownership, and historical tooling were identified as areas where documentation could overstate implementation maturity.

### 2.2 “100 particles” versus “128”

**Question:** Is the “100 particles” value supposed to be 100 or 128?

**Answer:** `100` is `PARTICLE_STRIDE`, not a population count and not a replacement for a law-state width. It is the number of `Float32` slots allocated per particle. The current source-derived law registry is 136 slots (`0–135`), while `MAX_PARTICLES` is 100,000. Older 128 references describe an earlier law boundary and must not be used as the current law count. Changing the stride would invalidate offsets across the solver, worker, renderer, persistence, and law modules.

### 2.3 Audit-suite location and new report

**Question:** Why is an audit-suite document in the root? Should it be merged with `docs/audit`? Save the audit as a new Markdown file.

**Answer:** The current checkout’s active scoped audit corpus is `docs/audit/laws/a3/`; a root `audit-suite/` directory is not present. The discrepancy is stale governance/documentation language, not evidence of two active corpora. The safe policy is to keep historical audit evidence in `docs/audit/`, generated structural specifications in `docs/spec/`, and runtime behavior in `src/` plus tests. Do not merge, delete, or relocate historical records until path-level provenance and consumer mappings exist. The clarification was recorded in `docs/DEEP_AUDIT_CLARIFICATIONS.md`.

### 2.4 WebGPU status

**Question:** Fully implement the WebGPU update.

**Consolidated answer:** The worker bridge now supports an opt-in WebGPU gravity pre-pass when configured, with the exact CPU solver retaining CONTACT, COLL, DNA-dependent behavior, lifecycle, fields, chemistry, information, quantum, and remaining mechanics semantics. Device acquisition, shader, mapping, and device-loss failures disable GPU execution and fall back to CPU. This is operational code and a safe fallback boundary, but browser/device execution is not established by Node contract tests alone. The remaining proof obligation is a real browser fixture with a WebGPU-capable device and deterministic CPU/GPU comparison.

### 2.5 Actionable remediation plan

**Question:** Generate actionable plans for the audit risks and proceed with remediation.

**Consolidated answer:** Remediation is sequenced around evidence before promotion:

1. Add executable audit sign-off gates.
2. Validate WebGPU in a real browser/device environment.
3. Establish backend error envelopes with exact CPU as reference.
4. Resolve the FMM placeholder: complete, retain experimental, or retire.
5. Consolidate mechanics geometry without allocations or semantic drift.
6. Add diagnostics for CONTACT, COLL, INERTIA, and TOPOLOGY.
7. Expand law ontology metadata by coupling and state risk.
8. Add focused semantic behavior tests.
9. Capture audit-stage provenance.
10. Map export consumers and retention states.
11. Exclude historical tools from active authority.
12. Continuously correct stale architecture/version/path claims.

The plan is actionable, but a plan or report does not itself close an implementation gap.

## 3. Batch structure and final batch 3+4 conclusions

The prior work was organized into batches. The final batch 3+4 conclusions are represented by the following matrix.

| Conclusion | Status | Required proof or follow-up |
|---|---|---|
| FMM is not production-complete | Evidence-resolved; technically open | Remove the `cellNeighbours` placeholder, validate near/far accounting, toroidal cases, DNA limitations, and population-scale error. |
| WebGPU is not universally operational by default | Policy-resolved; technically open | Execute browser/device parity tests and failure lifecycle tests. |
| Barnes–Hut is approximate | Evidence-resolved | Maintain error/performance envelopes; exact CPU remains reference. |
| Law registry catalogue is complete but ontology depth varies | Evidence-resolved; technically open | Expand relationship metadata and semantic tests. |
| Mechanics is not yet a universal hot-path abstraction | Evidence-resolved; technically open | Consolidate or justify scalar paths and add diagnostics. |
| Audit prose cannot replace behavior tests | Policy-resolved | Require executable evidence references for current sign-off. |
| Export snapshots lack complete ownership mapping | Policy-resolved; technically open | Map consumers and select canonical/CI/archive/removal status. |
| Historical tooling is not active verification authority | Policy-resolved | Retain recovery path until provenance and archive review are complete. |

## 4. Reconstructed answer to the architectural question

The central answer across the batches is that VEPA4 is a functioning bounded emergent simulation, not a complete scientific implementation of every named physical, biological, metaphysical, or quantum phenomenon. Several laws are intentionally implemented as bounded forces, state machines, field transforms, signal transforms, lifecycle transitions, or graph corrections. That is an acceptable simulation architecture when the status is explicit, parameters and gates are documented, behavior is tested, and no stronger physical claim is made.

The main quality risk is semantic unevenness: laws share a common registry and stride but do not all have the same ontology depth, conservation guarantees, parameter sensitivity, or test strength. The remediation target is therefore not to make every law identical; it is to make every law legible, bounded, testable, and honest about whether it is an exact numerical reference, an approximation, or a narrative/simulation proxy.

## 5. Carry-forward boundaries

- The CPU pairwise solver is the semantic reference, but “exact” should mean exact relative to the declared VEPA model and numerical configuration, not physically exact reality.
- Barnes–Hut, FMM, and GPU paths require separate tolerances and must not silently replace reference semantics.
- The current source-derived registry is 136 laws; documents that still say 128 require reconciliation.
- `docs/audit/laws/a3/` is retained evidence, not runtime authority.
- Exports are derived handoff artifacts, not a second source tree.
- Historical scripts and runners are retained for recovery only.
- A separate `vepa-exports` repository is a governance/deployment decision requiring repository provisioning and CI credentials; it cannot be safely assumed or configured solely by local Markdown edits.
