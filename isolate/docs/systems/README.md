# VEPA systems atlas

**Scope:** source-grounded organization, reproduction, lineage, ecology, and civilization analysis for VEPA4 9.1.12.

This atlas answers two different questions without conflating them:

1. **What exists in the runtime?** A verified implementation inventory with source paths and boundaries.
2. **What can VEPA theorycraft next?** An ontology and experiment framework for systems that are not yet first-class runtime entities.

A name such as *family*, *tribe*, or *nation* is therefore not treated as proof that a corresponding class exists. The live engine currently has particles, species slots, lineage records, detected/declared groups, group roles, territory, economy, governance, infrastructure, artifacts, memory, analytics, epochs, and synthetic/machine layers. It does **not** currently maintain explicit family, mating, tribe, clan, nation, or civilization entity types; those are interpretation layers over existing primitives unless promoted by future work.

## Navigation

- [Systems overview](overview.md) — implementation status and source matrix.
- [Ontology map](ontology.md) — entity, relation, scale, and lifecycle vocabulary.
- [Comparison matrix](comparison-matrix.md) — cross-system dimensions and evidence.
- [Analysis framework](analysis-framework.md) — how to deconstruct, observe, enable, and theorycraft systems.
- [Meta-model](meta-model.md) — proposed layered architecture and invariants.
- [Role catalog](roles/README.md) — one durable analyst/designer role for each system.
- [Implementation gaps](implementation-gaps.md) — explicit partial/missing boundaries and suggested next slices.
- [Module decomposition](module-decomposition.md) — source-grounded extraction plan for future runtime modules.
- [Deployment publication](deployment-publication.md) — why the atlas is copied into the static build output.

## Evidence notation

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Implemented** | Live runtime state and update path exists; source is cited. |
| **Proxy** | Runtime behavior approximates the concept without an explicit ontology/entity. |
| **Observed** | Analytics can infer the pattern from metrics/events, but does not own it as state. |
| **Scaffolded** | This atlas defines a design contract only; no runtime claim. |
| **Missing** | No reliable live implementation was found in the reviewed source surface. |

## Deployment note

The repository source of truth remains `docs/systems/`. Vite emits the application into `dist/` and does not copy arbitrary repository documentation. The production build therefore runs `scripts/publish-system-atlas.mjs` after Vite finishes, publishing this atlas at `/docs/systems/` without coupling the simulation runtime to Markdown files.

## Review rule

The atlas is intentionally conservative. Future code should add a primitive or measurement before adding a label. A civilization should be *discoverable* from population, group, memory, economy, governance, infrastructure, and persistence signals before it is named as an emergent category.
